# imageProcessWithArduino
Simple implementation to try image process with ESP32

In this project I used pythonanywhere.com as my server and use Flask as my framework

As the first step I have setup the server side to handle request. Since I was a beginer to this methods first I tried to extract some text from the POST requests that came to the server.
Then I tried to store that text on a file in the server as a csv file.Then I also tried to store that text on sqlite database. My attempt was succeed. In my reposit I include that file named storeText.py
